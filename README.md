# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM and Sentiment Analysis for Pakistan Stock Exchange

This project aims to predict future stock prices for companies listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, sentiment analysis, and historical stock data. The model uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to analyze time-series data and predict stock trends. Additionally, sentiment analysis of financial news and social media posts is integrated to enhance the prediction accuracy.

## Key Features:

- **LSTM Model for Stock Price Prediction:** The project uses LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks to predict stock prices based on historical price data, capturing temporal dependencies.
- Sentiment Analysis: Sentiment analysis of news articles, tweets, and other textual data is used to gauge market sentiment and improve prediction accuracy.
- Knowledge Graph Integration: A knowledge graph built using Neo4j is employed to store and analyze relationships between stock data, companies, industries, and sentiment trends.
- Indicator Data: Integration with stock indicators for stock price analysis.
- React Front-End: A dynamic front-end built with React for visualizing stock trends, sentiment insights, and predictions.
- Python/Flask Backend: A Flask-based backend to serve the LSTM model, handle API requests, and manage data processing tasks.

## Technologies Used:

- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) for time-series forecasting
- Sentiment Analysis using NLP techniques
- Neo4j for Knowledge Graph Management
- React for Front-End Development
- Python/Flask for Backend Development
- Pandas & NumPy for Data Preprocessing
- Matplotlib & Plotly for Data Visualization
- TensorFlow/Keras for Machine Learning Model

## Project Structure:

- /frontend: Contains the React-based front-end application and flask API that communicates with the front-end.
- /model: Code for LSTM model training, evaluation, and predictions.
- /data: Scripts for data collection, preprocessing, and analysis.

Future Improvements:
Incorporate more advanced sentiment analysis techniques.
Add support for other stock exchanges beyond PSX.
Implement more sophisticated models (e.g., ARIMA, Transformer-based models) for price prediction.
Improve front-end UI for better interactivity.
